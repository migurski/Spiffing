/*
 * The Queen's Stylesheet
 *
 * Brits, take control of the web. Spiffing allows you to write your CSS and stylesheets 
 * in conformance to proper British English (also known as correct English) grammar and 
 * spelling regulations.
 *
 *
 * Example of use:
 * 
 * Take your typical string CSS which you want to be be parsed by
 * Her Majesty the Queen's Spiffing CSS parser:
 *
 * $royalty	= "body {
 *			background-photograph: url('photographs/my_corgies.png');
 *		}";
 *
 * Class is never to be forgotten when compiling such royal stylesheets, therefore, it is
 * with utter urgence that one begin to compile like so:
 *
 * $css 	= new spiffing($royalty);
 *
 * As you can see, one has to use but the finest, and simplest, techniques in order to achieve
 * their goal. Finally, we shall output our stylesheet for our friends across the pond:
 *
 * $css->output();
 *
 * Perfect!
